Points to consider:
1) time spent by passengers waiting - expected wait time
2) distance travelled by elevator
3) time taken to open and close the door
4) diff type of request - internal, external
5) direction - up, down
6) status of elevator - idle, busy?
7) simple - change direction only when elevator reaches top or bottom?
8) efficient - 2 buttons external request?
